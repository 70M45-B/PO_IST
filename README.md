## About this project
- The initial phase of the project (part 1), involved creating a comprehensive overview using [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language). This approach was adopted to enhance comprehension of the project's primary functions and objectives. By utilizing UML, we aimed to provide a clear depiction of the project's structure, relationships between components, and the overall flow of operations.
