## About this project

- command-line spreadsheet application for efficient data manipulation, cut/copy/paste operations, and serialization.
- The initial phase of the project (part 1), involved creating a comprehensive overview using [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) diagrams.
- The second part keeps the [Open/Closed Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle) by using design patterns like the visitor and the observer patterns, promoting scalability and minimizing the risk of introducing errors in the existing codebase.
